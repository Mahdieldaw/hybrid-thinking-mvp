# Hybrid Thinking MVP

## Description

Hybrid Thinking is an intelligence orchestration platform that turns any web-accessible AI into a programmable model, then runs Generateâ†’Synthesize workflows. The system transforms diverse AI perspectives into coherent, actionable outputs through structured workflows that leverage model diversity for superior results.

## High-Level Component Overview

Hybrid Thinking is organized as a monorepo with the following structure:
- `packages/`: Shared libraries and utilities
- `services/`: Backend services
- `apps/`: Frontend applications
- `configs/`: Configuration files
- `docs/`: Documentation

The system consists of five core components:

1. **UniversalModelRegistry**: Abstracts any AI model into a common interface through API, Browser, and Local adapters.

2. **TokenVault**: Securely stores and manages credentials for various model providers.

3. **ExtensionCoordinator**: Enables browser-based model access through a Chrome extension.

4. **WorkflowEngine**: Orchestrates intelligence workflows with staged execution.

5. **ExecutionContext & TransportLayer**: Maintains state and provides I/O across multiple interfaces.
